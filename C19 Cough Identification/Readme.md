# COVID-19 Cough Sound Classification Using MFCC and CNN

This project aims to develop a classification system capable of identifying COVID-19 patient cough sounds using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as feature extraction and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classification model.

## Dataset

The data used to build this model is taken from the following link https://github.com/virufy/virufy-covid.
Thanks to virufy who can provide this data.

## Methodology

We employed MFCC to extract distinctive features from cough sound recordings and CNN to perform classification based on these features. The model has been trained using deep learning techniques to achieve accurate results in COVID-19 identification.

## Results

The model we trained successfully achieved high accuracy in classifying COVID-19 cough sounds. Comprehensive results and evaluation metrics can be found in the [results document](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-detect-covid19-cough-from-mel-spectrogram-using-convolutional-neural-network/).
